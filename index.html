            Radar systems are crucial in many roles in military combat aircraft, where locating and tracking enemy units, as well as being detected can be the difference between a mission success or failure. AESA radar systems are a recent advanced development, utilising multiple TR/Ms to track and scan multiple targets simultaneously, as well as overcome various weaknesses of older systems.

Radar systems are a necessity in modern military combat aircraft, aiding the pilot in communicating between friendly aircraft, and detecting, tracking and engaging hostile air, land and sea targets from within and beyond visual range (BBMF – RAF, 2024; Lockheed Martin Corporation, 2024). In many cases, a more advanced radar suite than an adversary will allow for a pilot to obtain more information, fast, and at longer range, increasing awareness in a combat zone and moving the odds in their favour.

There a multiple classes of radar system, and this article will focus on standard array, Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) and Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar systems.

        <p class = "ex1">
        <pre>
Standard array radar systems consist of multiple antenna elements, where emitted radio frequencies are emitted in phase, so that they superpose to form radar beams. Radar beams bounce off objects and create a return signal, which is detected by the receiver element of the radar array (Brain, 2024). To scan a wider angle, standard radar array systems must have the entire radar assembly mechanically rotated to point at a different angle, effectively limiting the scan speed of the radar by the mechanical system the radar system is mounted on.

A Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar system is a type of radar antenna array, in which the beam of radio waves can be electronically steered in different directions without moving the antenna array assembly. This is achieved with timing wave phases to cause constructive and destructive interference. All antenna elements are connected to a single transmitter / receiver unit. Power from the radar transmitter is passed through a module known as a phase shifter, delaying the signal through each antenna and changing the direction of the resultant beam (MathWorks, 2024).

Electronically Scanned Arrays (ESA) must be multiple wavelengths across to achieve the correct gain for a narrow beamwidth, and therefore to keep ESA systems at a sensible size, the radar must operate at very high frequencies (microwave), where the wavelengths are small. (Visser, 2005; Mini-Circuits, 2023)
            
Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) takes this a step further, in which multiple transmit / receive modules (T/RMs) are present on one radar assembly, allowing the radar to operate on multiple different frequencies simultaneously, as well as scan and track individual entities with each T/RM operating independently.

A T/RM consists of a transmitter, receiver and antenna packed into a module, essentially acting as a scaled down PESA system with fewer antennas. Each T/RM is able generate and transmit its own independent signal at a different frequency, giving AESA systems the capability of utilising multiple simultaneous sub-beams, each individually able to search and track different angles without interfering with one another (as each T/RM is running on a separate frequency) (Leonardo UK, 2024; Real Engineering, 2023, 18:57).
